    <h1>A Beautiful Day at the Beach</h1>
    
    <p>The sun is shining, the waves are crashing, and the sand is warm beneath your feet. A day at the beach is always a relaxing experience.</p>
    <p>Whether you're building sandcastles, swimming in the ocean, or just lying in the sun, the beach has something for everyone. Donâ€™t forget to bring your sunscreen!</p>
